A webscript offering a simple interface for creating ebooks in the epub format.

#### Note:

This webscript is written for a specifig environment. Many things are implemented in a shoddy way and should be replaced
with libraries and/or proper implementations. However, since the webscript must run under python 2.6 and is intended
as a learning experience as well as a simple utility script, certain "compromises" were made. Tread carefully.
